\begin{abstract}
The representation of the basic elements of music - such as notes,
ornaments and intervalar structures - in terms of discrete audio
signals is often used in software for music creation and design.
Nevertheless, there is no unified approach that relates these elements to the sound discrete samples.
In this article, each musical element is related by equations to the discrete-time samples of sounds,
and each of these relations are implemented in scripts within a software toolbox,
referred to as \massa\ (Music and Audio in Sequences and Samples).
The toolbox also includes this article and every script necessary to render the images
and musical examples, pieces and album, which adds to the educational and artistic uses.
The fundamental element, the musical note with duration, volume, pitch and timbre,
is related quantitatively to the characteristics of the digital signal.
Internal variations, such as tremolos, vibratos and spectral fluctuations,
are also considered, which enables the synthesis of notes inspired by real instruments and new sonorities.
With this representation of notes, resources are provided for the generation of further musical structures,
such as rhythmic meter, pitch intervals and cycles.
Such a framework enables precise and trustful scientific experiments and is useful for education and art.
The efficacy of \massa\ is confirmed by the synthesis of small musical pieces using basic notes,
incremented notes and notes in music, which reflects the organization of the toolbox and of this article.
It is possible to synthesize whole albums through collage of the scripts and parameterization specified by the user.
With the paradigm of open source implementation, \massa\ toolbox can be promptly scrutinized, expanded in co-authorship processes and used freely by musicians, engineers and other interested parties.
In fact, \massa\ has already been employed by external users for diverse purposes which include music production,
artistic presentations, psychoacoustic experiments and computer language diffusion where the appeal of audiovisual artifacts is exploited for education.
