### ToDo

#### Email to other authors:
- Confirm institutional ties of authors and their names in English.
- note to other authors that we have many footnotes.
- ask to other authors if they miss citations in some parts (e.g. first sentences of intro) or is it ok to rely in our own knowledge.
- maybe make a PDF with the scripts as another SI document.

#### In the last reading
- place figures in best places.
- remove repetition of what has been seen before (recaps).
- join (or at least enhance their relation) the sections of reverberation.
- remove piece names in the beginning of the third section.
- move localization and reverberation to the third section or make an explicit account the hybrid aspect off them.
- see if bibliography is ok.
- read listings.pdf again so ensure everithing is ok.
- enhance the conclusions section (maybe remove information that might be considered spurious).

#### In the submission
- in the submission, say that we can write a vocabulary with definitions and alternative terms.
- say that we can move some of the article to another supporting information, if it is too long
- state in the cover letter that we can reduce the size of the article if needed, e.g. by describing the musical pieces/usage in an supporting information document.

##### Context of the article (mainly reflects in the introduction) 
FINISHED!

###### Code (and musical pieces)
- review the code from each section, for the figures, aux and that render music. Make an additional EP routine.
Put all the code in a new, better organized repository.
- give better names to musical pieces and use English.
- add license and authorship header in the massa python and latex scripts.

###### Notes in music (most issues seem related to this section)
- account for phrases and melody construction (check e.g. Schoenberg's Fundamentals of Musical Composition).
- account for spectral music composition and other post-serial techniques.
- better account for serial techniques.
- account for sonic textures.
- maybe visit denis smalley (spectromorphology of sound).
- see music composition in wikipedia.
- Make explicit that one merit of the article is the effort to sum up musical theory, many more discussions can be easily added but we believe that from the article on, the reader can look into other articles and books.
- maybe change the order of some sections. E.g. put tonal harmony before atonal harmony, put motives right before tunning, etc.
- maybe explain what is a measure (and maybe what is a bar) in the rhythm section.
- make explicit that the notes in music section does not benefit so much by expressions as equations as the other sections, but it is a very condensed presentation of musical theory and each subsection has algorithms and music in the massa toolbox.
- make music with arcs using some famous sequences.
- check the red book for the notes for new music (especially the sequences).
- redo the lucas series calculations (check if in massa, add scripts for it and other sequences).
- put the right name of the peal in the cyclic arcs section.

### Already OK
- Obtain grant numbers (e.g. FAPESP from Chu) OK
- Ask Chu not to collapse multiple lines into one. OK
- Are there boundaries on sound wavelengths in micro or macro scales? OK?
- enhance first figures. Change espectrum for spectrum and , for . in figure 3. OK
- write about the literature (from the appendix of the dissertation). OK
- homogenize capitalization in section titles and inline references and replace Subsection~\ref... by Section~\ref... OK
- change Musical use to Musical usages. OK
- put references and citations in ?? OK
- choose nice settings for the unpublished document (e.g. journal, year). OK
- write a section on vocabulary, synonyms and ambiguities? Maybe put it as a disclaimer in the conclusions and state that the section could not be at the introduction because rll the terms were not introduced yet. (sample/sampling frequency/rate; harmonic vs component; harmony (field vs chords vs equilibrium of elements); note as pitch as a pitch+duration as pitch+duration+timbre as an specific note of a score, music or instrument; timbre of instrument, of player, of a register, etc; tremolo as vibrato in some instruments (e.g. piano); OK
- change velocity to speed in the discussion about the Doppler effect.
- write a supporting information file with a table with all the scripts and related equations (search multline), musical pieces and figures and important tables. OK
- make an index in the beginning of each section or of the article. E.g. spatial location or spatialization is not even cited until the subsection is reached. Maybe make the index as an appendix or put it in the introduction, relating concepts, equations and implementations (files and line numbers). OK because of listings.pdf
- state in the introduction that, in fact, most pieces in massa are not very traditional in their sonorities and discourse. OK
- review equation layouts. OK
- write about the extreme quality of massa synthesis which uses 64bits per sample, updates on the synthesis parameters sample-by-sample, and lookup tables with arbitrary size and sample precision.
Make explicit that there are a lot of discussion among specialists on the impact of sample rate and bit depth, for example, and that music software often uses 16 or 24bit bit depth and audio chunks to make synthesis lighter. OK 
- make a disclaimer in the introduction or the fourth chapter that there are many theoretical framework for music and that most often there is not a single way to express or characterize musical structures.
Therefore, the article contains many adjectives such as "often" "commonly" "frequently" and they might be even more numerous if we wanted to be very precise. OK
- decide on lambda or delta for inter-sample duration. OK
- use mass (music and audio in sample sequences) acronym instead of massa. OK
