### ToDo

#### Email to other authors:
- Confirm institutional ties of authors and their names in English.
- write a section on synonyms and ambiguities?
- note to other authors that we have many footnotes.

#### Tasks to tackle directly in the article
- put references in ??
- write about the literature (from the appendix of the dissertation).
- place figures in best places.
- homogenize capitalization in section titles and inline references.
- choose nice settings for the unpublished document (e.g. journal, year).

##### Context of the article (mainly reflects in the introduction)
- write a supporting information file with a table with all the scripts and related equations, musical pieces and figures and important tables.
- make an index in the beginning of each section or of the article. E.g. spatial location or spatialization is not even cited until the subsection is reached. Maybe make the index as an appendix or put it in the introduction, relating concepts, equations and implementations (files and line numbers).
- state in the introduction that, in fact, most pieces in massa are not very traditional in their sonorities and discourse- review equation layouts.
- write about the extreme quality of massa synthesis which uses 64bits per sample,
updates on the synthesis parameters sample-by-sample, and lookup tables with arbitrary size and sample precision.
Make explicit that there are a lot of discussion among specialists on the impact of sample rate and bit depth, for example, and that music software often uses 16 or 24bit bit depth and audio chunks to make synthesis lighter.
- remove piece names in the beginning of the third section.
- move localization and reverberation to the third section or make an explicit account the hybrid aspect off them.
- state in the cover letter that we can reduce the size of the article if needed, e.g. by describing the musical pieces/usage in an supporting information document.
- make a disclaimer in the introduction or the fourth chapter that there are many theoretical framework for music and that most often there is not a single way to express or characterize musical structures.
Therefore, the article contains many adjectives such as "often" "commonly" "frequently" and they might be even more numerous if we wanted to be very precise.
- see if bibliography is ok.
- decide on lambda or delta for inter-sample duration.
- Use mass (music and audio in sample sequences) acronym instead of massa.
- enhance the conclusions section (maybe remove information that might be considered spurious).

###### Code (and musical pieces)
- review the code from each section, for the figures, aux and that render music. Make an additional EP routine.
Put all the code in a new, better organized repository.
- give better names to musical pieces and use English.
- add license and authorship header in the massa python and latex scripts.

###### Notes in music (most of the issues seem related to this section)
- account for phrases and melody construction (check e.g. Schoenberg's Fundamentals of Musical Composition).
- account for spectral music composition and other post-serial techniques.
- better account for serial techniques.
- account for sonic textures.
- maybe visit denis smalley (spectromorphology of sound).
- see music composition in wikipedia.
- Make explicit that one merit of the article is the effort to sum up musical theory, many more discussions can be easelly added but we believe that from the article on, the reader can look into other articles and books.
- maybe change the order of some sections. E.g. put tonal harmony before atonal harmony, put motives right before tunning, etc.
- maybe explain what is a measure (and maybe what is a bar) in the rhythm section.
- make explicit that the notes in music section does not benefit so much by expressions as equations as the other sections, but it is a very condensed presentation of musical theory and each subsection has algorithms and music in the massa toolbox.
- make music with arcs using some famous sequences.
- check the red book for the notes for new music (especially the sequences).
- redo the lucas series calculations (check if in massa).
- put the right name of the peal in the cyclic arcs section.

### Already OK
- Obtain grant numbers (e.g. FAPESP from Chu) OK
- Ask Chu not to collapse multiple lines into one. OK
- Are there boundaries on sound wavelengths in micro or macro scales? OK?
- enhance first figures. Change espectrum for spectrum and , for . in figure 3. OK

### Vocabulary
- campo harmônico => harmonic field?
- anti-relative => counter-relative? (discussão sobre harmonia funcional)
- associada relative => associated relative? (ver a discussão para mais...)
- medianas cromáticas => cromatic mediant
- tonalidade => key
- homônima => homonymous
